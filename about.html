        <h1><strong>About Project: CleanEarth</strong></h1>
        <!-- <p>Imagine a world where we must wear special masks to protect us against air pollution, a world where we cannot swim in the oceans because it's severly polluted and dirty, and more. I don't know about you, but to us that seems pretty inhabitable and unsettling. Yet, it's all over the news today, look at China. One group of individuals strives to change that. Project: CleanEarth. These three people are laser-focused towards global sanitation. 
            Loren is the head of resear deal with reasearching all our materials, and makes sure that our committment to quality goes beyond the purchase screen. Umesh is our co-developer. He's the driving force behind our amazing website.Alvin is our CEO and our other co-developer. Alvin works on the coding and he simultaneously works on the other details of the company.</p> -->
        <br/>  <h1><strong>Mission Statement:</strong></h1>
            <br><p><strong> We believe that the CleanEarth program can revolutionize sanitation globally, through providing supplies and utilities that can be used to maintain a pristine environment. Our one for one program also provides a humanitarian aspect to our vision, by giving a box of supplies to people of struggling countries for every one that is purchased. Our Clean -  Mind,  Body & Soul program also supports mental health, a criminally undervalued aspect of one's bodily health.</strong></p>
